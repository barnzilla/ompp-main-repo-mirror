/*NOTE(ProbMort, EN)
This is an artifical note.  It's purpose is to
- test previous normalization of NOTE content
- test next version of normalization which converts to markdown format
- a third thing which I forget

It is also possible in "Modgen markdown" to create a code block which is rendered literally.
An example follows.

>line 1 of of the code block
>    line 2 of the code block
>        Line 3, indented further
>    line 4, back to previous indentation
>line 5, zero indentation 
>line 6 final line of code block

That's all, folks!
