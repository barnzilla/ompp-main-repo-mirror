Ceci est une note bidone pour UnionDurationBaseline, fournie comme fichier .md.  It's purpose is to
* test previous normalization of NOTE content
* test next version of normalization which converts to markdown format
* a third thing which I forget

It is also possible in "Modgen markdown" to create a code block which is rendered literally.
An example follows.

````text
line 1 of of the code block
    line 2 of the code block
        Line 3, indented further
    line 4, back to previous indentation
line 5, zero indentation
line 6 final line of code block
````

That's all, folks!
