### Introduction

RiskPaths is a simple model with substance.
That makes it ideal for illustrating many aspects of OpenM++.
At the time of writing, there were 963 references to RiskPaths in the 
[OpenM++ wiki](https://github.com/openmpp/openmpp.github.io/wiki).

Substantively, RiskPaths can be used as a model to study childlessness and was developed for training purposes. Technically, RiskPaths is a demographic single sex (female only), data-driven, specialized, continuous time, case-based, competing risk cohort model. It is based on a set of piece-wise constant hazard regression models.  

In essence, RiskPaths allows the comparison of basic demographic behaviour before and after the political and economic transitions experienced by Russia and Bulgaria around 1989. Its parameters were estimated from Russian and Bulgarian data of the Generations and Gender Survey conducted around 2003/04. Russia and Bulgaria comprise interesting study cases since both countries, after the collapse of socialism, underwent the biggest fertility declines ever observed in history during periods of peace. Furthermore, demographic patterns were very similar and stable in socialist times for both countries, which helps to justify the use of single cohorts as a means of comparison (one representing life in socialist times, the other the life of a post-transition cohort). In this way, the model allows us to compare demographic behaviour before and after the transition, as well as between the two countries themselves.
