### Second union formation 

A woman becomes exposed to the second union formation risk if and when her first union dissolves. As a difference to the first union formation which is based on age, this process does not start at a fixed point in time but is triggered by another event (first union dissolution). Accordingly, the time intervals of the estimated piecewise constant hazard rates refer to the time since first union dissolution.
