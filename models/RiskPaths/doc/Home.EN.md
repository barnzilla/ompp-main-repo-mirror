# RiskPaths Home

RiskPaths is a simple, competing risk, case-based continuous time microsimulation model. Its main use is as a teaching tool, introducing microsimulation to social scientists and demonstrating how dynamic microsimulation models can be efficiently programmed using
[Modgen](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/microsimulation/modgen/modgen-eng.htm) 
or 
[OpenM++](https://openmpp.org/) 
. 
The 
[OpenM++ wiki documentation](https://github.com/openmpp/openmpp.github.io/wiki) 
uses RiskPaths extensively in examples.
