  A series of OzProj model versions accompany the on-line course "Practical Microsimulation".
  That course presents how to use Modgen to construct a microsimulation model
  to produce detailed demographic projections from a large heterogenous microdata population.

  The course content also teaches how to use Modgen through concrete self-contained examples.

  The model is based on data from the web site of the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
