Windows users:
--------------

This directory may contain extra binaries for Windows, such as:

SQLite: http://www.sqlite.org/

Bison and flex: http://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/

You don't need bison and flex to build or run openM++ models.
If you want to build omc (openM++ compiler) then you must have bison and flex.
